App is resurrecting...  

Currently working primarily on the Frontend with React, Typescript & Radix UI.
It is separated from the backend server for now.  



To run the client after cloning the repo you should run:
```sh
cd ./restaurant-finder/client
```
```sh
npm install && npm run dev
```

Server is built with Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Jest w/ Supertest for testing, Cloudinary for image storage
