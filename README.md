App under development. Currently focusing on the server side. I have set up basic GitHub actions for CI/CD, will update when tests are ready.

server is built with Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Jest w/ Supertest for testing, Cloudinary for image storage \
client is built with React and TailwindCSS (no TS for now)
